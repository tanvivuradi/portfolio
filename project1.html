    <h2>Learning Design Proposal: Structuring the Course for Success</h2>
The Learning Design Proposal served as a blueprint for course development, outlining content structure, multimedia integration, and instructional strategies. This document ensured alignment with learning objectives, SME expertise, and best practices in online education.

<h3>Needs Analysis & SME Collaboration</h3>
Before developing the course, I conducted a needs analysis to identify key pharmacist training gaps and ensure alignment with healthcare regulations. This involved reviewing existing resources, analyzing learning requirements, and gathering insights from stakeholders. Once the objectives were defined, I coordinated with SMEs, instructional designers, and project leads to refine the content and instructional approach.

To maintain consistency and engagement, I facilitated a kick-off meeting with SMEs, outlining:

Project goals and learning objectives
Course structure and multimedia integration plan
Development timeline and key milestones
<h3>Action Mapping: Defining Key Learning Actions</h3>
To ensure the course directly supported pharmacists' real-world responsibilities, I used Action Mapping to align content with practical application. The key focus areas included:

        âœ… Collect â€“ Gathering patient information and assessing symptoms
âœ… Assess â€“ Evaluating eligibility for minor ailment treatment
âœ… Plan â€“ Determining the best course of action for prescribing medication
âœ… Implement â€“ Applying knowledge to real-world scenarios through interactive cases
âœ… Monitor â€“ Following up with patients and ensuring treatment effectiveness

    </div>

<h3>Course Blueprint & Development</h3>
With the structure defined, I developed the Learning Design Proposal, which included:

<li>Course Structure: Organizing content into digestible, well-paced modules</li>
<li>Storyboarding: Outlining text-based and visual elements to ensure engagement</li>
<li>Multimedia Planning: Integrating videos, animations, and interactive case studies to enhance retention</li>
Once the proposal was finalized, I began the LMS development phase, building out modules in Canvas LMS and implementing interactive elements like:
ðŸ“Œ Scenario-based decision-making activities
ðŸ“Œ Drag-and-drop learning exercises
ðŸ“Œ Multimedia content for diverse learning preferences

<h3>Prototype & Testing</h3>
To ensure usability and effectiveness, I developed a prototype module and gathered SME and stakeholder feedback. This iterative process allowed me to refine content structure, adjust interactive elements, and improve accessibility.

<h3>Review & Quality Assurance</h3>
        
Before the final launch, the course underwent expert reviews and usability testing. SMEs validated content accuracy, while instructional designers ensured that learning objectives were met. After multiple revisions, the course was finalized and prepared for deployment.

<h3>Launch, Implementation & Evaluation</h3>
The course was successfully launched, providing over 2,500 pharmacists across BC with essential training. I implemented learner feedback mechanisms using Qualtrics surveys and performance data analysis to continuously improve the course. Based on feedback, I refined content, adjusted interactivity, and enhanced accessibility to ensure an optimal learning experience.

<h3>Impact & Results</h3>
This project significantly improved pharmacist training by providing a structured, interactive, and practical learning experience. The course not only expanded pharmacistsâ€™ ability to prescribe minor ailment treatments and contraceptives but also contributed to improved patient care accessibility across BC.

âœ… Successfully trained 2,500+ pharmacists across BC
âœ… Improved learner engagement through interactive content and multimedia
âœ… Strengthened pharmacist readiness for real-world application


        
        
        <h2>Action Mapping</h2>
       <p>By collaborating with subject matter experts (SMEs) and analyzing the learning needs, I identified core actions that directly support the desired learning outcomes. Action Mapping serves as a foundation for designing and developing effective online courses by ensuring that every module and activity is aligned with these key learner behaviors.</p>

<h2>Instructional Design Approach</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Needs Analysis and Stakeholder Coordination</strong><br />At the start of each project, a <strong>needs analysis</strong> is conducted to identify the key learning objectives and gaps. This involves reviewing project requirements and ensuring alignment with organizational goals (e.g., BC government&rsquo;s pharmacist initiative). Following this, the project is announced to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), and interested individuals reach out to participate. Updates are provided once SMEs are finalized for the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kick-off Meeting with SMEs</strong><br />In the initial meeting with SMEs, the project timeline, deadlines, and the learning design process are introduced. This ensures all stakeholders are aligned on expectations and the course objectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning Design Proposal Development</strong><br />After receiving the full course content, a comprehensive <strong>Learning Design Proposal</strong> is created. This proposal acts as a guide for developing the course, detailing content distribution, and identifying opportunities to integrate multimedia elements such as images, videos, and interactive activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design Proposal Review and Collaboration</strong><br />A meeting is scheduled with SMEs to review the <strong>Learning Design Proposal</strong>. This collaborative session allows for feedback on design decisions, ensuring the course meets content accuracy, learner engagement, and performance objectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Course Development and Design</strong><br />After design decisions are confirmed, the course is developed in the Learning Management System (LMS). This phase includes structuring the course, creating multimedia content (videos, interactive activities), and ensuring that the course design supports learner engagement and knowledge retention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Final Review and Quality Assurance</strong><br />Before the course is launched, final feedback is gathered from SMEs and Expert Reviewers. This review process ensures that the course content is accurate, aligns with the learning objectives, and is ready for learner engagement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
       

        <h2>User-Centered Enhancements</h2>
        <ul>
