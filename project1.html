        <h1>Designing MACS Courses for BC Pharmacists</h1>
        <p>This project involved the design and development of online courses for pharmacists in British Columbia to expand their scope of practice in treating minor ailments and prescribing contraceptives.</p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Enable pharmacists to deliver enhanced healthcare services by providing accessible, high-quality online courses.</p>
          <p><strong>Collaborators:</strong> Subject matter experts from the UBC Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences and the Office of Education Technology and Learning Design (OETLD).</p>
          <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong>
                <li>Learning Management System (LMS): Canvas</li>
                <li>Collaboration Tools: SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Zoom</li>
                <li>Content Creation Software: Articulate, Camtasia, Vyond, Adobe Creative Suite, H5P</li>
                <li>Survey Tools: Qualtrics for learner feedback collection, Excel</li>
        </p>
           <h2>Process</h2>
<h3>Needs Analysis &amp; SME Collaboration</h3>
<p>Before developing each course, I participated in a needs analysis with SMEs and Project Managers to identify learning gaps and define requirements, ensuring alignment with the Pharmacists' Patient Care Process. This process involved gathering insights from stakeholders and clarifying the project scope. Once the objectives were established, I collaborated with SMEs and project managers to create a timeline with key deadlines.</p>
<h3>Action Mapping</h3>
<p>To ensure the course directly supported pharmacists' real-world responsibilities, I used Action Mapping, a framework designed to align training content with specific job tasks. In the context of this project, it focused on identifying key actions pharmacists need to perform in clinical settings as per the Pharmacists' Patient Care Process and ensuring the course content effectively addressed these actions. The key focus areas included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collect</strong> &ndash; Gathering patient information and history</li>
<li><strong>Assess</strong> &ndash; Evaluating eligibility for minor ailment treatment</li>
<li><strong>Plan</strong> &ndash; Determining the best course of action for prescribing medication</li>
<li><strong>Implement</strong> &ndash; Applying knowledge to real-world scenarios through interactive cases</li>
<li><strong>Monitor</strong> &ndash; Following up with patients and ensuring treatment effectiveness</li>
</ul>

<h3>Course Blueprint & Development</h3>
<p>With the structure defined, I developed the Learning Design Proposal, which included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Course Structure: Organizing content into smaller, well-paced modules including header styling</li>
<li>Storyboarding: Outlining text-based and visual elements to ensure engagement</li>
<li>Multimedia Planning: Integrating videos, animations, and interactive case studies to enhance retention</li>

</ul>
     <h3>Prototype & Testing</h3>
To ensure usability and effectiveness, I developed a prototype module and gathered SME and stakeholder feedback. This iterative process allowed me to refine content structure, adjust interactive elements, and improve accessibility.
Once the proposal was finalized and approved by stakeholders, I began the LMS development phase, building out modules in Canvas LMS and implementing interactive elements like:
<ul>
<li>Case-based activities</li>
<li>Drag-and-drop learning exercises</li>
<li>Multimedia content for diverse learning preferences</li>
</ul>

<h3>Review & Quality Assurance</h3>
        
Before the final launch, the courses underwent expert reviews and usability testing. SMEs validated content accuracy, while designers ensured that user interactions were seamless. After multiple revisions, the courses were finalized and prepared for launch.

<h3>Launch, Implementation & Evaluation</h3>
The courses were successfully launched, providing pharmacists across BC with essential training. I implemented learner feedback mechanisms using Qualtrics surveys and performance data analysis to continuously improve the course. Based on feedback, I refined content, adjusted interactivity, and enhanced accessibility to ensure an optimal learning experience.

<h3>Impact & Results</h3>
This project significantly improved pharmacist training by providing a structured, interactive, and practical learning experience. The courses not only expanded pharmacistsâ€™ ability to prescribe minor ailment treatments and contraceptives but also contributed to improved patient care accessibility across BC.

 
<li>Improved learner engagement through interactive content and multimedia</li>
<li>Strengthened 2,500+ pharmacist readiness for real-world application</li
