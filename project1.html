        <h1>Designing MACS Courses for BC Pharmacists</h1>
        <p>This project involved the design and development of online courses for pharmacists in British Columbia to expand their scope of practice.
        <p>This project involved the development of eLearning courses for pharmacists in British Columbia to expand their scope of practice for 21 minor ailments and contraception. This project aimed to create accessible, interactive online courses for pharmacists to confidently perform these expanded services.</p>

       <h2>Project Overview</h2>
<div style="background-color: #000; width: 100%; color: #FFF; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);">
  <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Enable pharmacists to deliver enhanced healthcare services by providing accessible, high-quality online courses that train them in treating minor ailments and prescribing contraceptives.</p>
  <p><strong>Collaborators:</strong> Subject matter experts from the UBC Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences and the Office of Education Technology and Learning Design (OETLD).</p>
  <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Learning Management System (LMS): Canvas</li>
    <li>Collaboration Tools: SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Zoom</li>
    <li>Content Creation Software: Articulate, Camtasia, Vyond, Adobe Creative Suite, H5P</li>
    <li>Survey Tools: Qualtrics for learner feedback collection, Excel</li>
  </ul>

        <h2>Instructional Design Approach</h2>
        <ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Needs Analysis and Stakeholder Coordination</strong><br />At the start of each project, a <strong>needs analysis</strong> is conducted to identify the key learning objectives and gaps. This involves reviewing project requirements and ensuring alignment with organizational goals (e.g., BC government&rsquo;s pharmacist initiative). Following this, the project is announced to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), and interested individuals reach out to participate. Updates are provided once SMEs are finalized for the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kick-off Meeting with SMEs</strong><br />In the initial meeting with SMEs, the project timeline, deadlines, and the learning design process are introduced. This ensures all stakeholders are aligned on expectations and the course objectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning Design Proposal Development</strong><br />After receiving the full course content, a comprehensive <strong>Learning Design Proposal</strong> is created. This proposal acts as a guide for developing the course, detailing content distribution, and identifying opportunities to integrate multimedia elements such as images, videos, and interactive activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design Proposal Review and Collaboration</strong><br />A meeting is scheduled with SMEs to review the <strong>Learning Design Proposal</strong>. This collaborative session allows for feedback on design decisions, ensuring the course meets content accuracy, learner engagement, and performance objectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Course Development and Design</strong><br />After design decisions are confirmed, the course is developed in the Learning Management System (LMS). This phase includes structuring the course, creating multimedia content (videos, interactive activities), and ensuring that the course design supports learner engagement and knowledge retention.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Final Review and Quality Assurance</strong><br />Before the course is launched, final feedback is gathered from SMEs and Expert Reviewers. This review process ensures that the course content is accurate, aligns with the learning objectives, and is ready for learner engagement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
       

        <h2>User-Centered Enhancements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyzed post-course surveys to refine content and improve user experience.</li>
            <li>Enhanced content accessibility and engagement by aligning with best practices in eLearning design.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Outcomes and Impact</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Expanded learning resources for over 2,500 pharmacists across British Columbia.</li>
            <li>Increased pharmacist readiness for prescribing minor ailment treatments and contraceptives, enhancing patient care accessibility.</li>
        </ul>
