    <h2>Learning Design Proposal: Structuring the Course for Success</h2>
The Learning Design Proposal served as a blueprint for course development, outlining content structure, multimedia integration, and instructional strategies. This document ensured alignment with learning objectives, SME expertise, and best practices in online education.

<h3>Needs Analysis & SME Collaboration</h3>
Before developing the course, I conducted a needs analysis to identify key pharmacist training gaps and ensure alignment with healthcare regulations. This involved reviewing existing resources, analyzing learning requirements, and gathering insights from stakeholders. Once the objectives were defined, I coordinated with SMEs, instructional designers, and project leads to refine the content and instructional approach.

To maintain consistency and engagement, I facilitated a kick-off meeting with SMEs, outlining:

Project goals and learning objectives
Course structure and multimedia integration plan
Development timeline and key milestones
<h3>Action Mapping: Defining Key Learning Actions</h3>
To ensure the course directly supported pharmacists' real-world responsibilities, I used Action Mapping to align content with practical application. The key focus areas included:

    <li>Collect – Gathering patient information and assessing symptoms</li>
<li>Assess – Evaluating eligibility for minor ailment treatment</li>
    <li>Plan – Determining the best course of action for prescribing medication</li>
<li>Implement – Applying knowledge to real-world scenarios through interactive cases</li>
       <li>Monitor – Following up with patients and ensuring treatment effectiveness</li>

<h3>Course Blueprint & Development</h3>
With the structure defined, I developed the Learning Design Proposal, which included:

<li>Course Structure: Organizing content into digestible, well-paced modules</li>
<li>Storyboarding: Outlining text-based and visual elements to ensure engagement</li>
<li>Multimedia Planning: Integrating videos, animations, and interactive case studies to enhance retention</li>
<li>Once the proposal was finalized, I began the LMS development phase, building out modules in Canvas LMS and implementing interactive elements like:</li>
     <ul>
<li>Scenario-based decision-making activities</li> 
<li>Drag-and-drop learning exercises</li>
<li>Multimedia content for diverse learning preferences</li>
         </ul>

 <div class="container">   
<h3>Prototype & Testing</h3>
To ensure usability and effectiveness, I developed a prototype module and gathered SME and stakeholder feedback. This iterative process allowed me to refine content structure, adjust interactive elements, and improve accessibility.

<h3>Review & Quality Assurance</h3>
        
Before the final launch, the course underwent expert reviews and usability testing. SMEs validated content accuracy, while instructional designers ensured that learning objectives were met. After multiple revisions, the course was finalized and prepared for deployment.

<h3>Launch, Implementation & Evaluation</h3>
The course was successfully launched, providing over 2,500 pharmacists across BC with essential training. I implemented learner feedback mechanisms using Qualtrics surveys and performance data analysis to continuously improve the course. Based on feedback, I refined content, adjusted interactivity, and enhanced accessibility to ensure an optimal learning experience.

<h3>Impact & Results</h3>
This project significantly improved pharmacist training by providing a structured, interactive, and practical learning experience. The course not only expanded pharmacists’ ability to prescribe minor ailment treatments and contraceptives but also contributed to improved patient care accessibility across BC.

 
<li>Improved learner engagement through interactive content and multimedia</li>
<li>Strengthened 2,500+ pharmacist readiness for real-world application</li>
