    <h2>Research Highlights</h2>
    <p>
        I contributed to the research paper <strong>"How Should a Social Robot Deliver Negative Feedback Without Creating Distance Between the Robot and Child Users?"</strong>. Below is a summary of the three studies conducted as part of this research.

        <h3>Study 1: Co-Design of Facial Expressions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Explore the types of facial expressions children prefer on a social robot (Haru) to redirect their attention when distracted.</li>
            <li><strong>Participants:</strong> 26 children (5–12 years old).</li>
            <li><strong>Methodology:</strong> Children were asked to imagine a distracted classroom scenario and draw the facial expressions they would like the robot to display. Speech bubbles were added for what the robot might say.</li>
            <li><strong>Findings:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Children preferred cute, friendly, and non-punitive expressions over angry or fear-inducing ones.</li>
                    <li>Suggestions included fun interactions, dynamic eye/mouth shapes, and even external reinforcements like timers or rewar
