            <div>
                <h3>Study 1: Co-Design of Facial Expressions</h3>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Explore the types of facial expressions children prefer on a social robot (Haru) to redirect their attention when distracted.</p>
                <p><strong>Participants:</strong> 26 children (5–12 years old).</p>
                <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> Children were asked to imagine a distracted classroom scenario and draw the facial expressions they would like the robot to display. Speech bubbles were added for what the robot might say.</p>
                <p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Children preferred cute, friendly, and non-punitive expressions over angry or fear-inducing ones.</li>
                    <li>Suggestions included fun interactions, dynamic eye/mouth shapes, and external reinforcements like timers or rewards.</li>
                    <li>Few children used negative expressions like anger.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Study 2: Evaluation of Pre-Designed Expressions</h3>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Validate findings from Study 1 by using professionally designed robot expressions to mitigate bias from children’s drawing skills.</p>
                <p><strong>Participants:</strong> 8 children (5–11 years old).</p>
                <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> Children rated 23 facial expressions on a five-point scale for how encouraging they found them in motivating focus and task completion.</p>
                <p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Positive and pleasant expressions scored higher than negative or fear-inducing ones (e.g., anger).</li>
                    <li>Fear-inducing expressions were consistently rated the lowest.</li>
                    <li>The results aligned with Study 1, reinforcing the preference for non-punitive feedback.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Study 3: Testing Animated Simulations</h3>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Test the impact of animated robot expressions on children’s preferences and their interest in the robot as a study companion.</p>
                <p><strong>Participants:</strong> 20 children (5–8 years old).</p>
                <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> Participants watched 16 video clips of animated robot expressions and rated them using the same scale as Study 2. They also discussed whether they would want the robot as a learning companion.</p>
                <p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Positive expressions remained the most favored, while fear-inducing ones (e.g., anger, annoyance) were rated the lowest.</li>
                    <li>Movement in some animations (e.g., a countdown timer) introduced urgency, which reduced their appeal.</li>
                    <li>60% of participants said they would like Haru as a study companion, with some suggestions for improvement (e.g., making it a mobile robot).</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Key Takeaways Across Studies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Children preferred fun, friendly, and encouraging expressions for feedback.</li>
                    <li>Negative or fear-inducing expressions discouraged interaction and were not suitable for child-robot communication.</li>
                    <li>Co-designing with children revealed valuable insights into their preferences, emphasizing the importance of creating a nurturing and engaging robot personality.</li>
