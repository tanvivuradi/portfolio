        <h1>Project 3: User Research</h1>
        <p>This research explores how children between the ages of 5 and 12 respond to a social robot, Haru, designed to redirect their attention and motivate task completion in classroom settings. Through three carefully structured studies, the research team gathered insights into children’s preferences for the robot’s facial expressions and its role as a study companion. The findings emphasize the importance of fun, friendly, and non-punitive robot interactions to foster engagement and minimize distractions.</p>
        
        <h2>Study 1: Co-Design of Facial Expressions</h2>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Explore the types of facial expressions children prefer on a social robot (Haru) to redirect their attention when distracted.</p>
        <p><strong>Participants:</strong> 26 children (5–12 years old).</p>
        <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> Children were asked to imagine a distracted classroom scenario and draw the facial expressions they would like the robot to display. Speech bubbles were added for what the robot might say.</p>
        <p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Children preferred cute, friendly, and non-punitive expressions over angry or fear-inducing ones.</li>
            <li>Suggestions included fun interactions, dynamic eye/mouth shapes, and external reinforcements like timers or rewards.</li>
            <li>Few children used negative expressions like anger.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Study 2: Evaluation of Pre-Designed Expressions</h2>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Validate findings from Study 1 by using professionally designed robot expressions to mitigate bias from children’s drawing skills.</p>
        <p><strong>Participants:</strong> 8 children (5–11 years old).</p>
        <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> Children rated 23 facial expressions on a five-point scale for how encouraging they found them in motivating focus and task completion.</p>
        <p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Positive and pleasant expressions scored higher than negative or fear-inducing ones (e.g., anger).</li>
            <li>Fear-inducing expressions were consistently rated the lowest.</li>
            <li>The results aligned with Study 1, reinforcing the preference for non-punitive feedback.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Study 3: Testing Animated Simulations</h2>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Test the impact of animated robot expressions on children’s preferences and their interest in the robot as a study companion.</p>
        <p><strong>Participants:</strong> 20 children (5–8 years old).</p>
        <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> Participants watched 16 video clips of animated robot expressions and rated them using the same scale as Study 2. They also discussed whether they would want the robot as a learning companion.</p>
        <p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Positive expressions remained the most favored, while fear-inducing ones (e.g., anger, annoyance) were rated the lowest.</li>
            <li>Movement in some animations (e.g., a countdown timer) introduced urgency, which reduced their appeal.</li>
            <li>60% of participants said they would like Haru as a study companion, with some suggestions for improvement (e.g., making it a mobile robot).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Children preferred fun, friendly, and encouraging expressions for feedback.</li>
            <li>Negative or fear-inducing expressions discouraged interaction and were not suitable for child-robot communication.</li>
            <li>Co-designing with children revealed valuable insights into their preferences, emphasizing the importance of creating a nurturing and engaging robot personality.</li>
        </ul>
